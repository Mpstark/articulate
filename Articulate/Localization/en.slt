	Articulate is a brilliant tool for ArmA players designed to make commanding 
	your squad as easy as possible.\n
	Anybody who's played ArmA knows that the commanding menu, while being incredibly 
	powerful, is one of the most confusing and time consuming aspects of squad control. 
	Articulate has been designed to make commanding your squad as simple as possible, 
	allowing you to use your microphone to give them commands.
